/**
 string : This is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, 
 enclose it in single or double quote marks.

    let myVariable = 'Bob'; or
    let myVariable = "Bob";

Number : This is a number. Numbers don't have quotes around them.

    let myVariable = 10;

Boolean : This is a True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords that don't need quote marks.

    let myVariable = true;
Array: This is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.

    let myVariable = [1,'Bob','Steve',10];
    Refer to each member of the array like this:
    myVariable[0], myVariable[1], etc.

Object : This can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable.

    let myVariable = document.querySelector('h1');
    All of the above examples too.
