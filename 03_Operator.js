// Operator
/**
 * Operator : An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values
 *  Addition : Add two numbers together or combine two strings.
 * Subtraction:
 * Multiplication:
 * Division:
 * 
 * 
 * Assignment : this assigns a value to a variable.
 *      symbol(=)
 * 
 * Strict equality : This performs a test to see if two values are equal and of the same data type. It returns a 
 * true/false (Boolean) result.
 *      symbol(===)
 * 
 * Not, Does-not-equal : This returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes. It turns a true into a false, etc.. 
 * When it is used alongside the Equality operator, the negation operator tests whether two values are not equal.
 *      symbol(!, !==)
 * 
 *
